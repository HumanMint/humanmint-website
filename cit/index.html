		<h1>Tomatoes</h1>


		<h2>Tomatoes are great. They are red, round, juicy, and definitely not apples.</h2>

		<p>We never talk about those damn apples. Apples are gross, apples are lame, apples are useless, the only reason why they're relevant is because stupid newton discovered gravity because of a dumb apple.</p>
